# sunny_storage

The project SmartGrid is conducted for the course 'Heuristieken' for the Minor Programming (2019) at the University of Amsterdam. In this project there are three different neighborhoods, all with 150 houses and 5 batteries. All of the houses have solar panels and need to store the energy they produce in a battery. The houses are connected with cables to the batteries. The goal for this project is to connect houses in a way that the total costs are lowest. Total costs are based on cable price per gridline and battery costs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The codebase is written in [Python3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Packages can be found in requirements.txt. These packages are needed for running the code. Installing can via pip dmv, namely:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure

* Algoritms: in this folder are all the scripts for programmed algorithms.
* Classes: all needed classes are in this folder. We implemented classes for houses, batteries and the grid.
* Data: all data that we created is in this folder. Most of the data is saved in .csv files.


You can run the entire code by running main.py:

```
python main.py [number of the neigborhood]
```
