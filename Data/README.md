# Data

This folder contains all the neighborhoods and batteries for this project.

### Neighborhoods 'Wijk1', 'Wijk2', 'Wijk3'
These are the standard neighborhoods created by the minor programming. Files:
* **huizen.csv** for all the houses
* **batterijen.csv** for all the batteries
* **wijk.png** for an image of the neighborhood
* **huizensortedhigh-low.csv** a list of the houses sorted from highest to lowest output

### Neighborhood 'Wijk4'
Since the standard neighborhoods have a big state space (7E104), running time and memory cost of the implemented algorithms is very high. We created a neighborhood with a smaller state space in order to test our algorithms. Files:
* **huizen.csv** for all the houses
* **batterijen.csv** for all the batteries
