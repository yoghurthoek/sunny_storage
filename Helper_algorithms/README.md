# Helper_algorithms

In this folder are the functions that all algorithms need.

* **bestplot:** this function saves a plot is the calculated prices better is than the already saved plot.
* **clustertoclasses:** this function chooses a battery for a cluster center and assigns the houses to the coordinates of the cluster
* **distancearr:** this functions calculates the distance for all possible battery-house connections and saves them to be fetched
* **nodetoclasses:** this function is needed for all the algorithms
* **price_calc:** this function calculates the cable price
* **reset:** this function is needed for the random algorithm
* **visualize:** this function visualizes the solution for the given neighborhood
* **write_to_csv:** this function appends the solution for the given neighborhood in a .csv file (neigborhood_prices.csv)
